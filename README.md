# Crime Vision - Crime Classification from Images

Crime Vision is a machine learning project that classifies different types of crimes based on images. It utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to identify patterns and features in crime-related images and categorize them into specific crime types. This project provides a web interface built with Flask for users to upload images and receive crime classification results.

## Features

- Crime classification based on uploaded images.
- Web interface powered by Flask for user interaction.
- Integration with a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Crime Vision project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x)
- Flask
- TensorFlow/Keras (for the pre-trained model)
- Other necessary libraries (as specified in the requirements.txt file)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

## Model Training

Use the .ipynb notebook and train the model and use it in the flask
